# Things about this

Hi, I needed to remove the .tvs file in the day5_datacontainers folder because the file was too large to be pushed to the repo, but still the jupyter notebook script is there with all the answers. I also needed to delete archive.zip.

Please remember to read the 'README.md' files on the folders of day2 and day3 to find the instructions how to run script and/or check externals links for the exersices
